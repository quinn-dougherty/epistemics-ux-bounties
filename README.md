# Epistemics UX Projects

Believing true things and measuring what we care about is hard. The power of web programming can help forecasters, analysts, philosophers, and philanthropists coordinate on what they believe and value, identify disagreements, communicate with peers and the general public, make bets, and update their worldviews in response to evidence. 

[EAGxSingapore talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q22ApsoGi12GZTnbXzzlhZL590OvDOblUKTN87pDmx4/edit?usp=sharing) contextualizing and advocating the basic field of study.

- [All](https://github.com/quinn-dougherty/epistemics-ux-projects/issues)

Ask an admin to `assign` you to your github account, which will move the issue in the `In Progress` column on [the board](https://github.com/users/quinn-dougherty/projects/1/). 

Re the `unpaid` label: I may ask Manifold for managram bounties at some point over the next few weeks, we can get a cash bounty system going at some point as well. 

Re the `have funding / inquire for fees` label: admins of the project board have nothing to do with fee discussions, that's between you and whoever posted the issue. 

# Pitch projects

All are welcome to let us know what you need ([Create issue](https://github.com/quinn-dougherty/epistemics-ux-projects/issues/new)). 

We may put in issue templates by topic area (wikis, prediction markets, estimational programming languages or stacks) later. 

Please use either the `unpaid` or `have funding / inquire for fees` labels. 

## Subjective scoped/concrete scores: 

- **Use your judgment but try to have approximately the same thresholds it seems preceding posts had**.
- `3/3` should almost be at the level of being the literal prompt for a programming finetune of GPT5, or trivial to refactor into that prompt.
- It's ok to be a little half-baked at `1/3`, but I'm thinking of something like [this one](https://github.com/quinn-dougherty/epistemics-ux-projects/issues/5) as the _most_ half-baked we want on the board.

## Difficulty and length of time estimates

I don't want to do this in the labeling system (too high a risk of typical-minding, since so many different skill levels will be coming together). Feel free to discuss your guesses about how hard things are or how long they'll take, but keep in mind how likely you are to be wrong.
